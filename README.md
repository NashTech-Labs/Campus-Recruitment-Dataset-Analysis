# Analysis of campus placement dataset using decision tree

In this worlflow we will analyse the Campus Recruitment Dataset using the decision tree algorithm.
- Loading the Campus Recruitment dataset and cleaning it to remove missing values and outliers.
- Partitioning the dataset into train and test dataset.
- Predict the placement status of the students with the help of Decision tree algorithm.
- Predict the expected salary of the students in the placemment with the help of Decision tree algorithm.
- Calculate the accuracy score of the model.
- Visualise the data to get some interesting information.
